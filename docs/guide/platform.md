# UGS Platform

The UGS Platform is the next generation of Universal Gcode Sender. It is built
ontop of the Netbeans Platform which allows us to leverage its mature modular
framework. This platform allows more features to be added without compromising
on code quality, or being bogged down by a home grown framework. The Classic
GUI is used as a library, so core features benefit both interfaces.
