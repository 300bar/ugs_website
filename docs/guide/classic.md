# Classic Interface

This is the classic user interface. Initially designed as a bare-bones gcode
sender it has grown in features since the initial release in 2012. It is built
with `Swing` using the `NetBeans Builder` built-in graphical GUI layout plugin.
The graphical nature of the plugin allows non-developers to tweak the interface
without needing to write any code.
