Website for [Universal Gcode Sender](http://winder.github.io/ugs_website/). The site is made using the [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) static site generator, which allows you to build a static webpage using a series of markdown files.

See the `docs` folder for markdown files. If you install the `mkdocs` utility on your machine you can test changes by running `mkdocs serve` and navigating to the location specified int he console output.

To make a new page simply register its location in the `mkdocs.yml`, and create a new `.md` file at the location specified.

If there's anything in particular you'd like to see feel free to open a ticket and ask.

For more information about how to contribute documentation see the mkdocs documentation:
